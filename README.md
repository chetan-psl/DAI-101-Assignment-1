## **Project Overview:**
This project explores wildfire incidents in California using a dataset of approximately **101,000** recorded fire incidents. The analysis covers various aspects of **fire density, structure vulnerability, and geographical spread** using statistical measures, visualizations, and geospatial mapping.

## **Objectives:**
- Perform **data cleaning** and handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Conduct **univariate analysis** to explore numerical and categorical distributions.
- Perform **multivariate analysis** to identify relationships between key wildfire attributes.
- Utilize **geospatial analysis** to visualize fire spread and density using heatmaps.
- Generate insights about **county-wise fire frequency, structure vulnerability, and time-based trends**.

## **Workflow:**

### **1️⃣ Data Cleaning:**
- Checked for missing values and handled inconsistencies.
- Converted relevant columns to appropriate data types.
- Removed irrelevant columns that do not contribute to the analysis.

### **2️⃣ Univariate Analysis:**
- Examined **fire incident frequency** across counties and cities.
- Visualized distributions of **fire damage severity, structure types, and distances from utilities**.
- Used **histograms, boxplots, and bar charts** to analyze individual variables.

### **3️⃣ Multivariate Analysis:**
- Computed **correlation matrices** to identify relationships between numerical features.
- Explored **damage severity vs. structure material** using boxplots.
- Analyzed **assessed property values vs. fire incidents** across different years.
- Used **scatter plots** to visualize geographical distribution of fire incidents.

### **4️⃣ Geospatial Analysis (Fire Spread & Density):**
- Created **heatmaps on California maps** to visualize fire density.
- Plotted **time-series trends** to observe yearly variations in wildfire occurrences.
- Mapped the **most affected counties and cities**.


## **Technologies Used:**
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium, Geopandas
- **Data Processing:** NumPy, Scipy
- **Jupyter Notebook**
